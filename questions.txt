server.js how would you read/interpret the (app) in code below?
// imports html routing calls
var htmlRoutes = require('./app/routing/htmlRoutes')(app);

why do you have to impor api before html?
require("./routes/apiRoutes")(app);
require("./routes/htmlRoutes")(app);

why isn't my catch() working line 176 survey.html
